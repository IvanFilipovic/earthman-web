EARTHMAN

THE USER MUST REPLACE THIS SECTION WITH THEIR OWN EARTHMAN AND DESCRIPTION.

Standards

MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES, NO EXCEPTIONS

    Stack: Nuxt, TypeScript, TailwindCSS v4, Django REST
    Patterns: ALWAYS use Composition API + <script setup>, NEVER use Options API
    ALWAYS Keep types alongside your code, use TypeScript for type safety, prefer interface over type for defining types
    Keep unit and integration tests alongside the file they test: src/ui/Button.vue + src/ui/Button.spec.ts
    ALWAYS use TailwindCSS classes rather than manual CSS
    DO NOT hard code colors, use Tailwind's color system
    ONLY add meaningful comments that explain why something is done, not what it does
    ALWAYS use named functions when declaring methods, use arrow functions only for callbacks
    ALWAYS prefer named exports over default exports
